# Progress Report 1: CTF Project
### Group Members:
- Caleb Kartchner
- Antonio Bejarano
- Thomas Nelson

### Progress:
We have established a shared GitHub repository that was cloned from [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd). In addition, we have started a documents folder in which we can keep progress reports and other important information. This will keep us organized as we continue to plan and build out our CTF server. 

Outside of technical preparation, we have prepared a plan for how we will develop the CTF server and its challenges. Each of us has taken a specific direction in regard to what challenges each of us will develop individually, meaning that each of us will theme the challenge(s) that we develop around a specific aspect of cybersecurity. 

The below table outlines each member's topic:
| Group Member | Topic |
| -------- | --------- |
| Caleb | Cryptography |
| Antonio | Password Cracking |
| Thomas | Network/Packet Analysis |

It is our hope that focusing on these three topics will allow users of our server to learn new things about each topic.

Additionally, we have decided to make our challenges to be relatively easy, catering to a beginner or mid-level Capture-the-flag player/hacker. The challenges will be designed to be fun, and not so overwhelmingly difficult that it deters people new to cybersecurity and CTF competitions.

We have also discussed attempting to host the server. For the time being, we will use the shared git repository to host the CTF challenges on our own machines during development, as we do not yet have a solution for deploying the CTF server (due mostly to port forwarding restrictions on our home networks). We will be looking for solutions to this in the coming weeks.
