## Final Report: CTF Project
#### Group Members:

- Caleb Kartchner
- Antonio Bejarano
- Thomas Nelson


I think that we all enjoyed the simplicity of the project. Researching and writing the challenges was also enjoyable for the group. The biggest problem of the project was getting a server up so we can work on the project together, but we found lots of solutions to this so it was just putting in the time to write interesting and fun challenges. 

Focusing on beginner to mid-level challenges was good too, as both I, Antonio, and Thomas are newer to CTF and we were able to replicate and make our own challenges that fit the difficultly of this project. Overall I think that our group did very well, Thomas and Caleb were able to create a lot of fun and interesting challenges so we could see the different kinds of challenges possible in this format. I had some issues connecting to the server we set up because I wasn't on the university Wi-Fi but was still able to contribute in the end.
