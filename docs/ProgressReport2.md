# Progress Report 2: CTF Project

### Group Members:
- Caleb Kartchner
- Antonio Bejarano
- Thomas Nelson

### Updates and Progress:
Following our initial setup and planning phases outlined in our first progress report, the team has made considerable strides in setting up the infrastructure necessary for our Capture-the-Flag (CTF) server and initiating the development of our cybersecurity challenges. Below are the highlights of our current progress:

1. **Server Setup**: We have successfully set up the server infrastructure necessary for hosting our CTF challenges. This foundational step involved configuring server settings, security measures, and ensuring our infrastructure can support the interactive nature of CTF challenges.

2. **Challenge Development In Progress**: As of this report, the team is actively working on developing the challenges within the thematic areas previously decided:
   - **Caleb**: Focused on a encryption related cryptography challenge.
   - **Antonio**: Working on a challenge that introduces password cracking.
   - **Thomas (Network/Packet Analysis)**: Developing a challenge centered around network and packet analysis.

   It's important to note that these challenges are currently under development. Our aim is to ensure that each challenge not only educates but also provides an enjoyable learning experience for ourselves and our classmates.

3. **Documentation and Planning**: We continue to document our progress and plans meticulously. Our documents folder has been updated to include detailed notes on our server setup process, challenge development strategies, and future steps. This organizational effort ensures that our project remains well-coordinated and aligned with our goals.

4. **Finalizing Challenge Development**: The immediate focus is on completing the development of the initial set of challenges. This includes thorough testing to ensure they are functional.

### Conclusion:
Our project is moving forward with a clear focus building beginner CTF challenges. While we are still in the development phase, the team is making steady progress towards creating an engaging and accessible CTF environment.
